        $ sudo make install

Usage:

    Results are modified by options preceded by a dash.
    Odot uses the first non-option as a subcommand.
    The rest of the line is parsed into a task.

    Available commands:
        new     Adds a new task to the list
        done    Marks a task on the list as complete
        show    Shows current tasks in database
        remove  Remove task from database

    Available options:
        -g (group)  Specify group for task
        -a          Show all groups
        -d          Also show completed tasks

Examples:

    Show tasks in default group:
        $ odot show

    Add a task called 'things to do' to a group called newgroup:
        $ odot new -g newgroup things to do

    Finish a task called 'thing I did' and show other completed tasks:
        $ odot done thing I did -d

    Show all completed tasks in a group called 'tasks':
        $ odot show -dg tasks

    Show all tasks in database:
        $ odot show -da
        
    Remove a task from database (completely removes task from odot's memory, useful for typos):
        $ odot remove task I want to forget
