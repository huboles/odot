         $ odot

     add a task to a group called newgroup:

     finish a task and show other completed tasks:
         $ odot -x "thing i did" -d

         $ odot -dg tasks

     show all tasks in database:
         $ odot -a

     remove a task from database (completely removes task from memory, useful for typos):
         $ odot -r "task i want to forget"
