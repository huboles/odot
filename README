Task manager written in C

Installation:
    
    Download source files
        $ curl "https://download.huck.website/odot-[VERSION].tar.gz" > odot.tar.gz

    Unpack source files
        $ tar -xzvf odot.tar.gz 
        $ cd odot

    Build odot
        $ make && sudo make install

Usage:

    Results are modified by options preceded by a dash.
    Odot uses the first non-option as a subcommand.
    The rest of the line is parsed into a task.

    Available commands:
        new     Adds a new task to the list
        done    Marks a task on the list as complete
        show    Shows current tasks in database
        update  Change group for a task
        remove  Remove task from database

    Available options:
        -g [group]  Specify group for task
        -a          Show all groups
        -d          Also show completed tasks
        -q          Don't show tasks
        -V          Display version

Examples:

    Add a task to default group:
        $ odot new "task"

    Show tasks in default group:
        $ odot show

    Add a task to a group called newgroup:
        $ odot new -g newgroup "things to do"

    Finish a task and show other completed tasks:
        $ odot done "thing I did" -d

    Show all completed tasks in a group called tasks:
        $ odot show -dg tasks

    Show all tasks in database:
        $ odot show -da
        
    Remove a task from database (completely removes task from memory, useful for typos):
        $ odot remove "task I want to forget"
